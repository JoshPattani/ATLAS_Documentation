          <h2>Project Pitch</h2>
          <div class="post-container">
            <p>
              The goal of this project is to create a computational design and
              fabrication workflow for three dimensional L-systems. I was
              inspired by my fascination of L-systems, ever since creating 2d
              variations earlier in the semester I have been eager to explore
              the possibilities of these forms in 3d. The workflow is
              implemented in Grasshopper and Rhino. The L-system geometry can be
              mapped onto a surface geometry, which is used to generate 3D
              printed forms of a three dimensional L-systems variations.
            </p>

          <h2>Walkthrough of Functionality</h2>
          <div class="post-container">
            <p>
              The Grasshopper and Rhino workflow is broken down into three main
              parts: 1) the surface Geometry, 2) the L-system, and 3) volumetric
              modeling. The Grasshopper definition begins by creating surface
              geometry. Users can choose from various primitive shapes or target
              external surfaces to initiate the foundation for the L-system.

              The L-system is implemented in Grasshopper using the Rabbit
              plugin. The Rabbit library contains components to implement a
              L-system and generate Turtle-drawn geometry. Users will be able to
              customize the L-system through a variety of parameters. I have
              included a variety of axioms and production rule sets, but these
              can be modified if users wish to do so.

          <div class="post-container">
            <p>
              The Rabbit library's Lsystem component generates an L-system using
              inputs to control the axiom, rule sets, and iteration count.
              Rabbit's turtle component uses the computed grammar to generate
              the corresponding L-system geometry. There are also parameters to
              control the Turtle's step length, step scale, and rotation angle.
              The L-system is mapped to the target surface by providing the
              turtle the object's surface frames as it's initial location and
              orientation.

            <p>
              The Dendro Grasshopper plugin affords the power and accuracy of
              volumetric modeling. The L-system curves are used to generate a
              manipulable mesh. Here we can control the size and resolution of
              the generated mesh, which is then converted to a volume object.
              Finally, the original target surface is converted to a volume and
              joined with the turtle volume to create a solid to then be
              exported as an STL file for 3D printing.

              The physical output of this project is a 3D printed object. I
              modified the geometry to make it a functional plant pot, as well
              as slicing off the bottom to create a flat surface that would be
              easier to print.The object was printed using PLA filament on a
              Prusa MINI 3D printer. The objects are printed with a 0.15mm layer
              height and 20% infill. The objects are printed with snug supports.

            <p>
              Overall I am satisfied with the results of this project. The
              process was more difficult in the beginning when I was attempting
              to build the GH definition with a python program to implement the
              3d L-system geometry. Upon doing more research and finding those
              plugins I scrapped that approach entirely. Afterwards, the process
              felt entirely streamlined and actually ended up being easier than
              I had thought. Next time I would I would add more surface
              manipulation techniques to make the objects even more organic, but
              I didn't have enough time to implement them efficiently. When
              adding some components from the Weaverbird library to the program,
              I think I crashed grasshopper over 5 times without any success.
              Additionally, I would look into some other types of 3d printing,
              aside from FDM, to fabricate these. SLA was suggested, but I was
              unable to complete the tour/workshop at the Idea Forge in enough
              time to fabricate. I think SLA would have allowed for more freedom
              in the physical output geometry.
