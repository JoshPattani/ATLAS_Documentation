            <p>
              Physarum Polycephalum, or Slime mold is a single-celled amoeboid
              organism that is capable of forming complex networks of veins to
              transport nutrients. This organism is particularly interesting
              because it is capable of solving complex problems, such as finding
              the shortest path between two points. The organism first spreads
              as a dense mesh to locate food. Once the mold has found nutrients
              it relies on sensory feedback from protoplasmic streaming to
              refine its mesh structure into optimal pathways. In the image
              above, slime mold is used to map the Tokyo train system. The
              organism is placed on a map of Tokyo with food placed at the
              locations of the train stations. The slime mold then forms a
              network of veins that connects the food sources, which is a close
              approximation of the Tokyo train system.

              The Nautilus is a cephalopod that is closely related to the squid
              and octopus. The Nautilus is unique in that it has a shell that is
              divided into chambers. The chambers are arranged in a logarithmic
              spiral, which is a spiral that grows at a constant rate. The
              Nautilus is born with a small shell and as it grows it adds new
              chambers to the shell. The Nautilus is able to control the size of
              the chambers it adds to its shell, which allows it to maintain
              neutral buoyancy. The Nautilus is able to control its buoyancy by
              actively adjusting the concentration of ions within the chamber
              solution to exchange gas and liquid as needed. The Nautilus is
              able to control the amount of gas and liquid in each chamber by
              using a siphuncle, which is a tube that connects each chamber to
              the animal's body. The Nautilus is able to move up and down in the
              water column by adjusting the amount of gas and liquid in each
              chamber.

              The Baya Weaver is a weaverbird indigenous to the Indian
              Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The Baya Weaver is known for its
              elaborate nests that are woven from grasses and palm leaves. It
              has been shown to be able to survive on trees up to 4 meters tall.
              The retort-shaped pendulous nests feature a central nesting
              chamber and a long vertical tube that serves as a side entrance to
              the chamber. The weavers often build these nests on the eastern
              side of a tree to protect the flock from monsoons that tend to
              come from the southwest.

              Computational design is used in architecture to create complex
              forms that would be difficult to design by hand. The architects
              Zaha Hadid and Frank Gehry are known for their complex designs
              that are made possible by computational design. Zaha Hadid's
              Galaxy SOHO building in Beijing, China features a complex curved
              facade that was designed using parametric design. Frank Gehry's
              Peix Olimpic building in Barcelona, Spain features a complex
              curved facade that was also designed using parametric design.

              design is used to create patterns for woven fabrics, knitted

              Mahdi Fard is an integrated computational designer from Iran whose
              expertise lies in Integrated Design within the realm of
              Architecture. He has cultivated a reputation for his adept
              handling of data flows, particularly in the context of Engineering
              Design, spanning a diverse range of Algorithmic Engineering
              consultancy projects in Iran. Notably, he serves as the lead
              developer for Caddisfly 01.01, an exclusive Grasshopper3D add-on
              tailored for the meticulous design of free-form structures. His
              contributions have propelled the growth of Ardaena.com into a
              thriving professional network.
              <br /><br />
              What is most interesting to me is Mahdi's current research in the
              realm of AI and the algorithmic integration of data flows, with a
              specific focus on Generative Design rooted in Functional Paradigms
              within the domain of Geometry.

            <h4>Part 1: Laser Engrave Fabrication of Turtle Graphic Design</h4>
            <p>
              The turtle graphic design was created using the Turtle library in
              Processing. The design was then exported as an SVG file and
              imported into Adobe Illustrator. The design was then laser
              engraved and cut on 4.5 mm x 203 mm x 304 mm clear cast acrylic
              using a 75W laser cutter.

            <h4>Part 2: Laser Cut Fabrication of L-System Graphic Design</h4>
            <p>
              The L-System graphic design was created using L-System methods in
              Processing. I expanded upon my original design from LA1 after
              having a better understanding of how to implement memory in the
              drawing to create a branching system. The design was then exported
              as an SVG file and imported into Adobe Illustrator. The design was
              then laser engraved and cut on 4.5 mm x 300 mm x 400 mm black cast
              acrylic using a 75W laser cutter. During the vector engraving
              process I noticed that the laser was pulsated along the curves of
              the leaf petals. With the help of Zach in the BTU lab we realized
              that is was due to the way turtle draws curves in Processing. The
              curves were made of thousands of single pixels that were not
              joined together in any of the graphic softwares used in the work
              flow.

            <h3>Part 1: Parametric 3D Designs</h3>
            <p>
              The 3D models were created in Rhino using Grasshopper. The
              Grasshopper script includes multiple controllable parameters that
              can be used to change the geometry of the generated shape.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The variable parameters include: 1. Size of object, which is
              determined by the size of the radius and height that will be used
              to create it. 2. Number of layers, which is used to determine the
              number of lofted surfaces that will be stacked on top of each
              other to create the solid object. 3. Sinusoidal curvature of the
              object, this parameter is controlled through the graph mapper
              component in grasshopper to scale the section curves of the object
              along a sine wave profile. 4. Rotation of the section curves, the
              angle of rotation is input via a controllable domain to rotate
              each section curve of the object by stepping through the range.

            <h3>Part 2: Creating a 3D-to-2D Slicer</h3>

            <p>
              The 3D models were created in Rhino using Grasshopper. The shapes
              were prepared to be laser cut using a Grasshopper script. The
              script components takes contours of the object along the Z-axis,
              the number of contours is determined by a number slider labeled
              'Mat. Thickness'. The contours are then arranged onto a grid
              created by the rectangular grid component in grasshopper. The
              sections were then baked to Rhino in preparation of laser cutting.
