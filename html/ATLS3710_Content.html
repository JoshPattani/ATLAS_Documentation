          <p>
            My favorite possession is a marvelous didgeridoo, hand-crafted by
            Adam "CrookedStixz" Henwood of Australia. This object is special due
            to the awesomeness in which these instruments are made. Traditional
            didgeridoos are made from trees that have been naturally hollowed
            out by termites in the Australian outback. After a tree is
            harvested, makers clean the trunk of debris and finish it to be a
            musical instrument, but the sound and tone of any didg is ultimately
            determined by the organic tunnels left behind by the termites.<br />
            <br />
            This musical instrument is made of Bloodwood Eucalyptus timber. The
            upper bell of the didgeridoo features an inlaid insignia made of
            crushed turquoise stone. The mouthpiece is constructed of natural
            dark beeswax.

          />
          <br />
          <p>
            For this project, I created a convex hexahedra out of wood. This
            variation is known as a pentagonal wedge.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            My original design was going to be a wild crystalline termination
            shape with many articulating faces. I wanted to make the form solid
            by beveling the edges of all the face shapes. But as I sat down with
            pen and paper to begin drawing the shape dimensions, I quickly
            realized the shape was way over complicated and I'd probably give
            myself a big headache trying to accomplish it.
          </p>
          <img
            class="gal"
            src="../assets/wood/Hexahedra/pentagonalPrism.jpg"
            alt="Pentagonal prism"
          />
          <p>
            So, I landed on my chosen form by scaling back to a regular
            heptahedron and slicing a 30&deg; plane through the shape to get my
            desired pentagonal wedge form.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <img
            class="gal"
            src="../assets/wood/Hexahedra/shapePerspectiveSketch.jpg"
            alt="sketches of shape in perspective view"
          />
          <img
            class="gal"
            src="../assets/wood/Hexahedra/shapeLayout.jpg"
            alt="dimensional sketches of shape sides"
          />
          <br />
          <p>
            After sketching out my shape I used 3D software to model my form. I
            then used digital tools to explode the shape into its individual
            sides and arrange the shapes onto a plane the same size as our given
            lumber.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <img
            class="gal"
            src="../assets/wood/Hexahedra/proto01.jpg"
            alt="prototype of shape"
          />
          <img
            class="gal"
            src="../assets/wood/Hexahedra/proto02.jpg"
            alt="prototype of shape"
          />
          <img
            class="gal"
            src="../assets/wood/Hexahedra/proto03.jpg"
            alt="prototype of shape"
          />
          <br />
          <p>
            I then used the software to create a prototype of the shape to test
            the fitment of the pieces. I used the prototype to make adjustments
            to the dimensions of the shapes to ensure a tight fit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the dimensions of the same pieces in the software I
            coordinated vertices of the shapes in relation to two axial edges of
            the board. I then used the coordinates to mark out the placement of
            the shapes on the physical piece of wood.
          </p>

          <br />
          <p>
            After marking out the shapes on the wood, I used the band saw in the
            wood shop to cut the pieces out, being sure to leave a bit of excess
            to be sanded smooth later on.
          </p>
          <br /><br />

          />
          <br />
          <p>
            After cutting out the pine pieces for test, it was time for the real
            deal.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <img

            alt="Oak board marked with shapes to be cut"
          />
          <br />
          <p>
            After cutting out the pieces, I used a belt sander to sand the
            pieces down to their final shape.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <img

            alt="extreme bevel jig"
          />
          <br />
          <p>
            This shape required a few extreme angle beveled cuts, mainly the two
            edges that meet at a 30&deg; corner. My original plan was take off
            as much as possible with the table saw and then hand plane the bevel
            back from there. But I instead decided to take the time to make a
            beveling jig from some scrap I had laying around for the table saw.
          </p>
          <br /><br />

            alt="some smooth looking grain"
          />
          <br />
          <p>
            After beveling the edges, I sanded the faces to remove any remaining
            saw marks and used a small block plane to smooth out the bevels.
          </p>

          />
          <br />
          <p>
            The fitment wasn't great, but once the pieces were smooth I cleaned
            them up of any fibers or dust in preparation of gluing.
          </p>
          <br /><br />

          />
          <br />
          <p>
            After gluing the pieces together, I used rubber bands and an
            arrangement of weights to provide pressure in lieu of specialty
            clamps.
          </p>
          <br /><br />

          />
          <br />
          <p>
            After the glue dried, I used a hand plane to smooth out the corners
            and remove any excess glue.
          </p>
          <br /><br />

          />
          <br />
          <p>
            After smoothing the edges, I used a belt sander to sand the piece
            down to its final shape.
          </p>
          <br /><br />

          <br />
          <p>It was then onto final sanding and finishing.</p>

          />
          <br />
          <p>
            I stepped through several grits of sanding, 60, 120, and 220 grit
            sandpaper, to achieve a smooth surface for finishing.
          </p>
          <br /><br />

          />
          <br />
          <p>
            After sanding, I applied a flood coat of Danish oil to the surface
            using a cloth. Once the oil soaked in, about 15 minutes, I reapplied
            oil and wiped clean
          </p>
          <br /><br />

          />
          <br />
          <p>
            After the oil dried overnight, I applied a second coat of danish oil
            by wet sanding it into the piece with 400 grit sandpaper.
          </p>
          <br /><br />

          />
          <br />
          <p>
            Once the the second coat had eight hours to dry, I repeated wet
            sanding a third coat of danish again with 400.

            Peggasus is a gondola made out of plastics source from my recycling
            bin. The gondola is made of a HDPE milk jug, 4 LDPE can rings, 1
            PETE egg carton and some LDPE plastic film bags. The gondola is
            attached to a plastic bottle cap that is attached to the milk jug
            cabin via can rings. The egg carton is slotted through the walls off
            the milk jug in order to secure the egg seats. The plastic bags were
            added under the seats to add cushioning for any turbulence that may
            occur. A front airbag and seat belts have been installed to ensure
            safe travel for any egg babies during their voyage on Peggasus!
