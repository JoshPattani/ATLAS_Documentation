          <p>
            My favorite possession is a marvelous didgeridoo, hand-crafted by
            Adam "CrookedStixz" Henwood of Australia. This object is special due
            to the awesomeness in which these instruments are made. Traditional
            didgeridoos are made from trees that have been naturally hollowed
            out by termites in the Australian outback. After a tree is
            harvested, makers clean the trunk of debris and finish it to be a
            musical instrument, but the sound and tone of any didg is ultimately
            determined by the organic tunnels left behind by the termites.<br />
            <br />
            This musical instrument is made of Bloodwood Eucalyptus timber. The
            upper bell of the didgeridoo features an inlaid insignia made of
            crushed turquoise stone. The mouthpiece is constructed of natural
            dark beeswax.

          <br />
          <p>
            For this project, I created a convex hexahedra out of wood.
            Specifically,a pentagonal wedge. My original design was going to be
            this crazy looking crystal like shape with my differently
            articulated faces. But as I sat down with pen and paper to begin
            layouts the shapes, I quickly realized the shape was way over
            complicated and I'd probably give myself a big headache trying to
            accomplish it. So, I landed on my chosen form by scaling back to a
            regular heptahedron and slicing a 30&deg; plane through the shape to
            get my desired pentagonal wedge form.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <img

          <img

            alt="dimensional sketches of shape sides"
          />
          <br />
          <p>
            After sketching out my shape I decided to use 3D software to model
            my form. I then used digital tools to explode the shape into its
            individual sides and arrange the shapes onto a plane the same size
            as our given lumber. Finally, I used measurement tools in the
            software to measure the location of vertex coordinates in relation
            to two perpendicular edges of the board. I then used the coordinates
            the markout the placement of the shapes on the physical piece of
            wood.
          </p>
          <br /><br />

          <img
            src="../assets/wood/pineShapeMarkout.jpg"
            alt="pine board marked with shapes to be cut out"
          />

          <br />
          <p>
            After marking out the shapes on the wood, I used the band saw in the
            wood shop to cut the pieces out, being sure to leave a bit of excess
            to be sanded smooth later on.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <img

            alt="pine pieces after belt sanding"
          />
          <br />
          <p>
            After cutting out the pieces, I used a belt sander to sand the
            pieces down to their final shape.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <img src="" alt="" />
          <br />
          <p>
            This shape required a few extreme angle beveled cuts, mainly the two
            edges that meet at a 30&deg; corner. My original plan was take off
            as much as possible with the table saw and then hand plane the bevel
            back from there. But I instead decided to take the time to make a
            beveling jig from some scrap I had laying around for the table saw.
            I figured with the pieces being so small this would advantageous in
            the preservation of my precious digits.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <img src="" alt="" />
          <br />
          <p>
            After beveling the edges, I used a hand plane to smooth out the
            bevels and remove any remaining saw marks.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <img src="" alt="" />
          <br />
          <p>
            Once the pieces were smooth, I cleaned them up of any fibers or dust
            in preparation of gluing.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <img src="" alt="" />
          <br />
          <p>
            After gluing the pieces together, I used a rag to clean up the edges
            and remove any excess glue.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <img src="" alt="" />
          <br />
          <p>
            After the glue dried, I used a hand plane to smooth out the edges
            and remove any excess glue.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <img src="" alt="" />
          <br />
          <p>
            After smoothing the edges, I used a belt sander to sand the piece
            down to its final shape.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <img src="" alt="" />
          <br />
          <p>It was then onto final sanding and finishing.</p>
          <br /><br />
          <img src="" alt="" />
          <br />
          <p>
            I stepped through several grits of sanding to achieve a smooth
            surface for finishing.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <img src="" alt="" />
          <br />
          <p>After sanding, I applied a coat of Danish oil to the piece.</p>
          <br /><br />
          <img src="" alt="" />
          <br />
          <p>
            After the oil dried, I applied a coat of paste wax to the piece.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <img src="" alt="" />
          <br />
          <p>
            After the wax dried, I buffed the piece with a rag to achieve a nice
            sheen.
