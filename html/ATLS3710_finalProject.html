            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              The final project for this course is to design and fabricate an
              object that incorporates two focus materials. The focus material I
              chose is 3/4" 13-layer birch plywood. The object I designed is a
              coat rack that can be mounted on a wall. The coat rack is made
              from a 47" x 18.25" cut of the plywood. The coat rack was
              fabricated using various materials and assembled with the use of
              fasteners and adhesives.

            <h3>Background, Characteristics and Origin of the Materials</h3>
            <p>
              The 3/4" 13-layer birch plywood is a composite material made from
              thin sheets of birch veneer that are glued together. The plywood
              is strong, durable, and resistant to warping thanks to the copious
              amount of veneer layers. The 3/4" black textured HDPE sheet is a
              thermoplastic that is commonly used in playground equipment. The
              material is durable, resistant to moisture with a great
              strength-to-weight ratio.

              The 3/4" 13-layer birch plywood and HDPE plastic rings were
              sourced from my employer, Eldorado Walls. These materials were
              already machine fabricated and going to be thrown away as a result
              of two separate failed research & development projects. I noticed
              the inner width of the plastic rings matched the width of the
              ovular cutouts in the birch plywood so, I decided to reclaim these
              precious materials and save them from their eternal landfill doom.

            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <p>
              I wanted to create a design that would aesthetically combine these
              random components into a coat rack. I decided to use the birch
              plywood as the main structural component of the coat rack and the
              HDPE plastic rings as accents. The plywood and plastic had
              existing holes in them that I could use to facilitate hooks. The
              design was inspired by a midi slider controller. The coat rack was
              designed to be mounted on a wall and the hooks were designed to be
              placed at varying heights to accommodate different sized coats.
            </p>
            <p>
              The coat rack was fabricated using a variety of tools and
              techniques. Disclaimer, as these materials were reclaimed I did
              not perform the following process on these specific materials on
              the day they were created. The birch plywood and HDPE plastic
              rings were cut using a CNC router. The birch plywood was sanded
              using an orbital sander. The edges of both materials were rounded
              over using a router table.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon envisioning a midi slider coat rack I thought to design up
              some 3d printed parts to raise the fidelity of the concept. The
              rings were only about 2/3 the length of the cutouts in the
              plywood, which afforded an excellent opportunity to create tracks
              that resemble slider tracks on a midi controller!
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
              The 3d printed parts were designed in Rhino and printed using a
              Prusa Mini in the BTU lab with PLA filament. While I modeling the
              slider tracks I thought to design some inserts for the existing
              holes in the material to implement the hooks. The plastic inserts
              are designed for a 3/8" wood dowel segment to glued in.

            <p>
              Once I had the concept finalized, it was time to paint. I used
              spray paint sourced from our local Home Depot to paint the wood
              and 3d printed parts.

              The coat rack was assembled using a combination of fasteners and
              adhesives. I found some kind of poly fabric to cut and glue onto
              the backs of the HDPE plastic rings to cover up ovular cutouts in
              the birch plywood. I designed the slider track fobs to bolt onto
              end of the plastic rings. The rings were attached to the birch
              plywood using wood screws.

              The hooks were assembled using the 3d printed inserts and 3/8"
              wood dowels. The inserts were made to be removable from the holes
              in the birch plywood and the dowels were glued into the inserts.

              After seeing the assembled object, I realized the fabric would
              make for a great light diffusing filter with some LEDs behind it.
              Luckily, I had a spare roll of LED strip laying around to make it
              so. I think it really tied it all together.
