    <!-- Key Point to Include for demo 
  ------------------------------- 
  Please prepare the following items on your documentation blog as “Mid-Progress Milestone - Final Project” and use them as part of your presentation.
  1. An Elevator Pitch. Write a clear three sentence high-level description of your project and its overall goal. 

  2. A Walkthrough of Functionality. Explain how someone uses your project. How does your script/code work? What outputs can be generated? If you have physical prototypes fabricated, you should show them and any photos you have captures of them.

          <div class="post-container">
            <p>
              The goal of this project is to create a computational design and
              fabrication workflow for three dimensional L-systems. The workflow
              will be implemented in Grasshopper and Rhino, and will be used to
              generate 3D printed forms of a three dimensional L-systems
              variations.

          <h2>Walkthrough of Functionality</h2>
          <div class="post-container">
            <p>
              The Grasshopper and Rhino workflow is broken down into three main
              parts: 1) the surface Geometry, 2) the L-system, and 3) the 3D
              model. The Grasshopper definition begins by creating surface
              geometry. Users can choose from various primitive shapes or target
              external surfaces to initiate the foundation for the L-system.

              The L-system is implemented in Grasshopper using the Rabbit
              plugin. The Rabbit library contains components to implement a
              L-system and generate Turtle-drawn geometry. Users will be able to
              customize the L-system through a variety of parameters.

          <div class="post-container">
            <p>
              The Rabbit library's Lsystem component generates an L-system using
              inputs to control the axiom, rule sets, and iteration count.
              Rabbit's turtle component uses the computed grammar to generate
              the corresponding L-system geometry. The L-system is mapped to the
              target surface by providing the turtle the object's surface frames
              as it's initial location and orientation.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Dendro Grasshopper plugin affords the power and accuracy of
              volumetric modeling. The L-system curves are used to generate a
              manipulable mesh. Here we can control the size and resolution of
              the generated mesh, which is then converted to a volume object.
              Finally, the original target surface is converted to a volume and
              joined with the turtle volume to create a solid to then be
              exported as an STL file for 3D printing.
